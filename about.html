          <p>This is a picture of me on my 30th birthday. My wife thought it would be funny to get me a shirt.
       This was in the middle of quarantine, so I wasn't exactly keeping myself as well-groomed as I normally would. I did find it funny,
      though, mostly because I feel like I'm older than a lot of people who are learning to code. That is odd to me, since 30 is still pretty young.</P>

          <p>This is my wife. She is pretty great if you ask me. That said, the cats don't really listen to her anymore than they listen to me.
            We aren't really in charge in our own home. It's a sad thing.

          <p>This is a picture of my cat, Ernie. He is kinda the boss around our place. He needs to go on a diet because he has recently gained weight after stealing food too often from the other cat.
          He bites, sadly.

          <p>This is a picture of my cat, Rudy. He is the baby of the family. He is very cuddly, but sometimes he yells in the middle of the night.
            We have recently figured out this because he's hungry. Ernie has been stealing his food. He gets extra meals now.
